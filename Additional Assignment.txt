Good morning, everyone. Let’s start with a quick status update.

Morning! The API integration is about 80% complete. We’re still testing edge cases, but it should be ready for QA by Friday.

I’ve finished the new UI mockups for the dashboard. I’ll share them after the call for feedback.

Thanks, Maria. Could you also prepare a quick walkthrough for the stakeholders next week?

[10:06 AM] Maria Lopez (Designer):
Yes, absolutely.

[10:08 AM] James Miller (QA Lead):
Quick update from QA — we found two critical bugs in the last sprint. Both have fixes in progress, and we’ll retest tomorrow.

[10:12 AM] Sarah Johnson (Project Manager):
Perfect. Let’s aim to close them before Friday’s demo. Any blockers we should be aware of?

[10:13 AM] Alex Chen (Developer):
Nothing major, just waiting on the API keys from the client.

[10:14 AM] Sarah Johnson (Project Manager):
Got it. I’ll follow up with them today. Thanks, everyone!

Example 2:
Hey team, so good evening everybody. We are extensively working hard on a critical project. So, based on this grooming session happening today,
 so whatever the conversations that we're going to have, that is going to be applicable for both development and testing team.Coming to the user stories perspective, 
 get all your quesionsclarified in today's call from our PO and get your user stories completed at your earliest possible.
 We are counting the story point as one (i.e This is not going to be a separate effort for dev & testing team). 
 All stories should be closed both development and testing effor witin the capacity defined. Both efforts should goes in parallel.
 Try to maximize all defects in the dev region before moving to testing environment, to ensure no defect has been leaked when we are moving to SIT phase. 
 I'm expecting to see the progress of the development and testing progress end of each day, so in that way we can track and capture the bottleneck of the user stories.
 We will take up the call based on the status. Team, please work extensively on weekdays and close all the activities.
 Otherwise we may have to need support on weekends, which we really don't want to be happen. 

output:
	Bullet in points
Persona:
   consider me as a scrum master who need to share the minutes of the meeting across the team
